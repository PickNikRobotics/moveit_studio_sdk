Python API for MoveIt Pro.

This package provides an [`ObjectiveManager`](moveit_pro_py/objective_manager.py) Python class which can be used to control MoveIt Pro Objectives.

The `examples` directory has several scripts which show how to run Objectives synchronously, asynchronously, and with parameter overrides.
